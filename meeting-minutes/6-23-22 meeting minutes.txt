faiss 1.3 s to compute 300 cosine similarties --> 0.03s
faiss is calculating the closest sentence, with accuracy of 99% 

stored: Would you like a glass of tea?
stored: I really like coke?
incoming: How about some coke?

Please build 10 of these use cases. What does faiss find?
If faiss picks the wrong sentence, then also use our POS tag scheme
(we compute some kind of POS tag-related distance)
