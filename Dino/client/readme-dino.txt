React client for a dialogue chatbot server based on BERT embeddings NLP
By Xinru He, William Cui, Dino Konstantopoulos, NU 2021

- Why do chinese characters not print on screen (but print ok in file)?
- Use bubbles on client to allow users to track dialogue
- Use syntax-based heuristics to improves guessing when there are mutliple high cosine similarity values that are close to each other (need to figure out what "close" means -- need testing)
- File picker dialog on client to allow users to upload other acts, and allow users to pick the act they want to exercise on
- Make it look nice!
- Is roberta-large the best option (facebook), or are there other options for embeddings?
- Add text to speech on the client! With different M/F voices!
